    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It emerged in Ireland and the United Kingdom in the late 1980s among neo-psychedelic groups who usually stood motionless during live performances in a detached, non-confrontational state. The name comes from the heavy use of effects pedals, as the performers were often looking down at their pedals during concerts, hence the name Shoe-Gaze.  
 Till this day, music fans are debating which of the holy trinity has prompted the most influential shoegaze record.  While My Bloody Valentine’s mind-bending Loveless had driven Alan McGee’s Creation Record to the brink of bankruptcy, Slowdive’s Souvlaki had received the most “mainstream” success and Ride’s Nowhere was a stand-out breezy shoegaze listen at the time. Shoegaze had ts rise and subsequent fall in the late 90s and all these bands have that same thing in common, and that's their split and venture out of their respective genres entirely for what it seemed like forever.
